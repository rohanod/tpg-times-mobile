Right now, when the time format is minutes, it calculates the delays but doesn't show a warning but if the time format is 24 hour time, it doesn't calculate the delays and still doesn't show the warnings

Set the background of the individual timing to orange when there is a delay. while keeping good contrast
and calculate the delay into the time, don't tell the user the delay. Always modify the files yourself, 
don't ask if you are allowed to start working.
