<!-- 1. Remove the times page properly and fix any things that might refer to it -->
<!-- 2. Use the arrets.csv filtering and checking like the js code has(JS code is in website.js) -->
3. Make the settings work because switching between light mode and dark mode doesn't work and switching between having the format in minutes and having the format in 24 hour time doesn't work
4. Allow tapping outside the popup to exit it
5. Make the 4 timings in a grid and make them a tiny bit wider to look better
6. Allow to pull the popup up to show more timings if applicable
7. Make the shadow not go up with the popup, make it fade in
8. Keep when you show the number filters consistent so have it always show stop name text box and always show bus/tram nu,ber textbox
9. Properly implement favourite stops so in the favourites page, it has a button that says "Add current stop to favourites"
10. Make the circle buttons a tiny bit smaller
11. Make the circles centred
12. It's not properly using the search.ch API to get the nicely formatted stop names when doing location detection
